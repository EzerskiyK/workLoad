**Description**

This web application was created for the university where I study (Gomel State University named after F. Skorina).
The application was created entirely by me. This web application is used to distribute the workload between teachers.
It controls the number of working hours of teachers, scheduling, automatic distribution of students into subgroups and so on.

**This application provides**
 
- working with Postgres database using Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security is implemented
- Spring Web MVC
- CSS
- HTML + Thymeleaf
- HTML + FreeMarker

**Optional**

If you want to run the project, you need to set up a connection to the database.
You need to create a file bdData.properties at the path /src/main/resources.
You can copy the contents of bdData.properties.origin (located in the same directory) and paste the data from your database.
